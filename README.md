# @incsub/emdash-contact-form

A built-in contact form for [EmDash CMS](https://emdash.dev). One form, one shortcode, submissions stored and managed in the admin UI. No SMTP setup, no per-form configuration — install it and it works.

> **Single-form by design.** This plugin ships one fixed contact form (Name / Email / Message). Configurable bits — success message, privacy note, spam protection, retention — live in the plugin Settings. If you need multiple forms with arbitrary fields, this isn't the right plugin.

---

## Features

- **One-line shortcode** — drop `<div data-form-slug="contact"></div>` on any page
- **Editor-friendly** — also available as a Portable Text block in the slash menu
- **Auto-injected loader** — no manual `<script>` tag needed if your layout uses `<EmDashHead />`
- **Submissions admin** — list, search, status filter (All / New / Read), soft-delete
- **Spam protection** — honeypot, minimum-submit-time, per-IP and global rate limits, same-origin check
- **Privacy-aware** — soft delete, configurable retention with daily auto-purge
- **Zero external runtime dependencies** — vanilla JS hydration, no NPM extras at runtime

---

## Install

Pin to a release tag (recommended for production):

```bash
npm install github:wpmudev/emdash-contact-form#v0.2.0
```

Or track the latest commit on `main`:

```bash
npm install github:wpmudev/emdash-contact-form
```

For local development against an in-progress copy of the plugin (see the [Developing the plugin](#developing-the-plugin) section for the full workflow):

```bash
npm install file:../path/to/emdash-contact-form
```

> The package name is `@incsub/emdash-contact-form` — that's the import path you'll use in your code. It will land in `node_modules/@incsub/emdash-contact-form/` regardless of which install method you use.

Then in `astro.config.mjs`:

```js
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
import emdash from "emdash/astro";
import { sqlite } from "emdash/db";
import { contactFormPlugin } from "@incsub/emdash-contact-form";

export default defineConfig({
  output: "server",
  integrations: [
    emdash({
      database: sqlite({ url: "file:./data.db" }),
      plugins: [contactFormPlugin()],
    }),
  ],
});
```

Restart the dev server. The plugin is ready.

> **Local-path installs only** (`npm install file:` or `npm link`) need a small Vite hint to dedupe the symlinked dependencies. Skip this if you installed from GitHub or npm:
>
> ```js
> vite: {
>   resolve: { dedupe: ["emdash", "astro"] },
>   optimizeDeps: { exclude: ["@incsub/emdash-contact-form"] },
> },
> ```

## Embedding the form

Two equivalent ways:

**A. In the EmDash editor.** Open any page, type `/`, pick **Contact Form** under the "Forms" category, save. The form renders on the published page.

**B. In Astro markup.** Drop this anywhere in any `.astro` page or Markdown file:

```html
<div data-form-slug="contact"></div>
```

The loader script is auto-injected (inlined as a `<script>` tag) into pages that include `<EmDashHead />` — which all default EmDash layouts do. When you change a setting in the admin, the live form updates automatically.

> **Important:** your page layout must include `<EmDashHead />`. That's where the loader script gets injected. Without it, the form won't render — there is no separate `loader.js` URL you can fall back to.

---

## Plugin options

```ts
contactFormPlugin({
  requireHoneypot: true,    // Default: true
  maxMessageLength: 5000,   // Default: 5000
  retentionDays: 0,         // Default: 0 (no auto-deletion)
})
```

These are seeded as KV defaults on first install and can be edited later from **Admin → Plugins → Form Settings**:

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `successMessage` | Shown in place of the form after a successful submission |
| `privacyNote` | Shown below the form |
| `requireHoneypot` | Reject submissions where the hidden honeypot field is filled |
| `maxMessageLength` | Cap on text / textarea field length |
| `retentionDays` | Auto-purge submissions older than N days at 02:00 daily (`0` disables) |

---

## Admin UI

The plugin adds two entries to the sidebar under **Plugins**:

- **Form Submissions** — list of all received messages. Status filter chips at the top let you switch between **All / New / Read**. Search matches name, email, message body, and page slug. Click **View** on any row to open the full submission — opening auto-marks it as read. The detail page also has a **Delete** button (soft-delete).
- **Form Settings** — auto-rendered editor for the success message, privacy note, honeypot toggle, max message length, and retention days.

The plugin's root path (`/_emdash/admin/plugins/contact-form`) shows an overview page with submission counts and the embed shortcode for quick copy-paste.

## Public API routes

All under `/_emdash/api/plugins/contact-form/`.

| Method | Path | Auth | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `submit` | Public | Visitor submission |
| `GET` | `form-config` | Public | Form config for the loader |
| `GET` | `submissions` | Admin | Paginated list |
| `GET` | `submission?id=…` | Admin | Single submission |
| `POST` | `submission?id=…` | Admin | Update status `{status: "read" \| ...}` |
| `DELETE` | `submission?id=…` | Admin | Soft-delete |

Admin routes are protected by EmDash's session middleware automatically.

### Response shape

All routes return plain objects. EmDash wraps them in a `{"data": ...}` envelope before sending to the client. Success and error shapes are uniform:

```jsonc
// Success
{ "ok": true,  /* …route-specific fields… */ }

// Error
{ "ok": false, "error": "<machine_code>", "message"?: "<human_readable>" }
```

Common error codes: `invalid_json`, `invalid_content_type`, `payload_too_large`, `forbidden_origin`, `rate_limited`, `validation_error`, `not_found`, `method_not_allowed`, `id_required`, `invalid_status`, `server_error`.

> The loader script is **inlined into every public page** via the `page:fragments` hook — there is no `loader.js` URL. EmDash's plugin route wrapper JSON-serializes all responses, so non-JSON content (loader script, CSV download) can't be served from a plugin route.

---

## Privacy & security

| Concern | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| **Untrusted input** | Stored raw, never executed; submission body capped at 64 KB; per-field length capped by `maxMessageLength` |
| **Cross-origin spam** | Submit endpoint rejects requests whose `Origin` header doesn't match the host (legitimate same-origin clients always pass) |
| **CSV formula injection** | Cells beginning with `=` `+` `-` `@` are prefixed with `'` so Excel / Sheets treat them as text |
| **Bots** | Hidden `_hp` honeypot rejects filled-honeypot submissions silently; submissions in under 2 s are treated as bot activity |
| **Rate limiting** | 5 / IP / 15 min, plus a global 60 / 15 min fallback for direct-IP deployments without `x-forwarded-for`. **In-process** — for multi-instance hosting, also enforce edge-level rate limits (Nginx, Cloudflare) |
| **IP capture** | Read from `x-forwarded-for` / `x-real-ip`. Document this in your privacy policy |
| **Soft delete** | `status: "deleted"` is hidden from the UI; not erased until the retention purge |
| **Plugin uninstall with `deleteData: true`** | All submissions hard-deleted; KV settings removed by EmDash |

## Custom domains / third-party hosting

The plugin uses **only relative paths** (`/_emdash/api/plugins/contact-form/...`), so it works on any custom domain without configuration. The loader fetches form config from the same origin the page was served from. Page slug is captured client-side via `window.location.pathname`.

If your site is mounted at a sub-path (e.g. `example.com/blog/`), EmDash's API still lives at `/_emdash/...` from the root — confirm your reverse proxy isn't stripping `/_emdash/` before requests reach EmDash.

If you serve behind Cloudflare or another reverse proxy, forward `x-forwarded-for` so per-IP rate limits work; otherwise the plugin falls back to its global counter.

---

## Limitations

1. **Single fixed form.** Fields are Name / Email / Message. No per-form customization, no multiple forms.
2. **No file uploads.**
3. **No CAPTCHA.** Wire one in `routes/submit.ts` before `validateSubmissionPayload()` if needed.
4. **In-memory rate limiter** — works per-process. Use edge-level limits for multi-instance.
5. **No GDPR self-service.** Visitors can't request their own data; admins handle deletion.

## Developing the plugin

Want to fix a bug or add a feature? Workflow:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wpmudev/emdash-contact-form.git
cd emdash-contact-form
npm install
```

Make your changes in `src/`. Then **build before committing or testing in a consumer site**:

```bash
npm run build       # regenerates dist/
npm run typecheck   # optional: confirms TS is clean
```

The compiled `dist/` is **committed to git** so GitHub installs work without needing the consumer's host to run a build step. If you change `src/` without rebuilding, your changes won't reach consumers until you do `npm run build` and commit `dist/`.

To test changes locally in a consumer site before pushing:

```bash
# In your consumer site
npm install file:../path/to/emdash-contact-form

# After every plugin change:
cd ../path/to/emdash-contact-form && npm run build && cd -
rm -rf node_modules/.vite .astro
npm run dev
```
